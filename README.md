# A demonstration of Nadia Eghbal's argument about the participatory nature of software and open source software at scale

This quick exercise is designed to demonstrate the load on Maintainers from _participatory_ open source.

## Exercise

Pretend that you use the software component called Super Acme Software. It's not important what the software _does_, it's just important for this exercise that you use it a lot, and that lots of people around the world use it too. It's a critical component in many cyber-physical systems in use in several application domains. Again, the key thing isn't what it **does**, but that there is a heavy **dependence** on it. 

Choose one of the sub-scenarios to follow below: 

1. Imagine you have found a bug in the software and want to get the bug fixed. 

* Click on [Issues](https://github.com/KathyReid/super-acme-software/issues).
* Most open source repositories have an _Issue Template_ to structure bug reports effectively. Do you like using the Issue Template? It's totally up to you whether you use it or not. Provide as much or as little information about the bug as you like. 
* If a maintainer responds to your Issue, consider engaging with them. What if they won't fix your bug? 

2. (If you're comfortable with GitHub), imagine you are a software developer with a change you would like to submit as a _contribution_ so that it counts towards Hacktoberfest.

* Fork this repo, make a change and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/KathyReid/super-acme-software/pulls)
* Pretend you don't know much about the Super Acme Software codebase, you just want the t-shirt! t-shirt!!!11!!!!
* If the maintainer responds to your PR, consider engaging with them. What if they don't accept your PR?
